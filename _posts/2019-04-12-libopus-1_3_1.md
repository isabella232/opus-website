This [Opus 1.3.1](https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/opus/opus-1.3.1.tar.gz) 
minor release fixes an issue with the analysis on files
with digital silence (all zeros), especially on x87 builds (mostly affects
32-bit builds). It also includes two new features:
- A new OPUS\_GET\_IN\_DTX query to know if the encoder is in DTX mode (last frame was either a comfort noise frame or not encoded at all)
- A new (and still experimental) CMake-based build system that is eventually meant to replace the VS2015 build system (the autotools one will stay).
